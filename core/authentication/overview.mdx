Delino provides secure authentication, offering safe access to the platform through multiple authentication methods. This guide covers authentication mechanisms, security features, and best practices.

## Authentication Methods

Delino supports two primary authentication methods:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Web Authentication" icon="key">
    **Dashboard Access**

    - Email/password login
    - Social login support
    - Automatic session refresh
    - Session management
    - Secure token-based authentication
  </Card>
  <Card title="API Keys (PATs)" icon="code">
    **Programmatic Access**

    - Used for API and service integration
    - Personal Access Tokens
    - Fine-grained scope permissions
    - Restricted to public APIs only
    - No dashboard access
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Authentication Flow

### How Authentication Works

Delino's authentication flow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Initiates Login">
    User navigates to Delino and clicks "Sign In"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authentication Page">
    User directed to authentication page:
    - Email/password login
    - Social login options
  </Step>

  <Step title="Credential Verification">
    System verifies credentials and validates user identity
  </Step>

  <Step title="Session Established">
    User redirected back to Delino with active session:
    - User record created/updated
    - Session established
    - Dashboard access granted
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API Key Authentication

### Personal Access Tokens (PATs)

API keys provide secure programmatic access:

<Warning>
API keys are **restricted to public APIs only**. They cannot access internal or admin endpoints.
</Warning>

**Key Features**:
- Created through Delino console
- Securely managed backend
- Fine-grained scope permissions
- Optional expiration (up to 100 years)
- Token value shown only once at creation

**Authentication Flow**:
```
API Request
├── Header: Authorization: Bearer deli_...
├── Extract token from header
├── Validate token
├── Verify scopes for requested operation
└── Grant/Deny access
```

### Scope-Based Authorization

API keys use scopes to control access:

**Format**: `service:resource:action`

**Examples**:
- `*` - Full access (development only)
- `service:*` - All operations for a specific service
- `service:resource:action` - Specific operation only

See [API Key Scopes](/core/api-keys/scopes) for complete reference.

### Public API Restriction

<Info>
API keys (PATs) can only access **public APIs**. Private and admin endpoints require web session authentication.
</Info>

**Public APIs** (accessible with API keys):
- Service-specific operations
- Usage reporting
- Resource management within scope

**Private APIs** (require web session):
- Admin operations
- User management
- System configuration
- Billing portal access (except via specific scope)

## API Key Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Secure Generation">
    API keys generated securely:
    - Cryptographic random suffix (24 bits entropy)
    - Unique internal names
    - Collision-resistant
    - Unpredictable values
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Storage">
    API keys stored securely:
    - Token value hashed
    - Only shown once at creation
    - Database stores hash only
    - Cannot be recovered if lost
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transmission">
    API keys transmitted securely:
    - HTTPS only
    - Authorization header
    - Never in URL parameters
    - Never in logs
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Validation">
    API keys validated on every request:
    - Token signature check
    - Expiration verification
    - Scope validation
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Session Management

### Web Sessions

Dashboard sessions managed automatically:

<ResponseField name="Session Duration" type="duration">
  Typically 7-30 days with automatic refresh
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Idle Timeout" type="duration">
  Configurable per organization

  Default: 30 minutes of inactivity
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Concurrent Sessions" type="number">
  Multiple sessions allowed

  Each device maintains separate session
</ResponseField>

### Session Features

- **Auto Refresh**: Sessions automatically refreshed before expiration
- **Remember Me**: Optional extended session duration
- **Multiple Devices**: Access from multiple devices simultaneously

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Strong Passwords">
    For your account:
    - Minimum 12 characters
    - Mix of letters, numbers, symbols
    - Avoid common patterns
    - Use password manager
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enable 2FA">
    Two-factor authentication:
    - TOTP (Google Authenticator, etc.)
    - SMS verification (if enabled)
    - Backup codes
    - Required for admin accounts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate API Keys">
    Regular API key rotation:
    - Every 90-365 days
    - After team member departure
    - On security incident
    - Document rotation schedule
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Sessions">
    Review active sessions:
    - Check for unknown devices
    - End inactive sessions
    - Review login history
    - Report suspicious activity
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Least Privilege">
    Apply principle of least privilege:
    - Minimum required scopes for API keys
    - Appropriate team roles
    - Regular permission audits
    - Remove unnecessary access
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Secure Credentials">
    Protect authentication credentials:
    - Never share passwords
    - Never commit API keys to git
    - Use environment variables
    - Rotate on exposure
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Log In

If you cannot log in to Delino:

1. **Verify Email**: Ensure using correct email address
2. **Reset Password**: Use password reset function
3. **Browser Issues**: Clear cache and cookies
4. **Contact Support**: If problem persists

### Session Errors

If you experience session issues:

1. **Session Expired**: Log out and log in again
2. **Clear Session**: Clear browser cache and cookies, then re-authenticate
3. **Contact Support**: If problem persists

### API Key Not Working

If API key authentication fails:

1. **Check Expiration**: Verify key hasn't expired
2. **Verify Scopes**: Ensure key has required permissions
3. **Public API**: Confirm endpoint is public (not admin)
4. **Header Format**: Use `Authorization: Bearer deli_...`
5. **Test Key**: Try simple API call to verify
