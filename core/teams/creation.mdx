## Team Slug Guidelines

The team slug is a critical identifier that appears in URLs:

### Requirements

<ResponseField name="Length" type="string">
  **4-20 characters**

  ✅ Valid: `team`, `engineering`, `data-science-2024`

  ❌ Invalid: `ai` (too short), `this-is-a-very-long-team-name-123` (too long)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Format" type="string">
  **Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens**

  ✅ Valid: `engineering`, `team-42`, `data-sci`

  ❌ Invalid: `Engineering` (uppercase), `team_42` (underscore), `team.42` (period)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Uniqueness" type="string">
  **Globally unique across all Delino teams**

  If slug is taken, try:
  - Adding numbers: `engineering-2`, `engineering-2024`
  - Adding organization: `acme-engineering`
  - Using abbreviations: `eng-team`, `data-sci`
</ResponseField>

### Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Be Descriptive" icon="tag">
    Use names that clearly identify the team's purpose

    **Good**: `frontend-team`, `data-science`
    **Bad**: `team1`, `abc`
  </Card>

  <Card title="Keep It Short" icon="compress">
    Shorter slugs are easier to remember and type

    **Good**: `eng`, `data`
    **Bad**: `engineering-department-team`
  </Card>

  <Card title="Avoid Dates" icon="calendar-xmark">
    Don't include years or dates that become outdated

    **Good**: `marketing`
    **Bad**: `marketing-2024`
  </Card>

  <Card title="Consider Growth" icon="chart-line">
    Choose names that scale with your organization

    **Good**: `engineering`, `sales`
    **Bad**: `johns-team`, `temp-project`
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Common Slug Patterns

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="By Department">
    Department-based naming:
    - `engineering`
    - `marketing`
    - `sales`
    - `finance`
    - `hr`
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="By Function">
    Function-based naming:
    - `frontend`
    - `backend`
    - `devops`
    - `qa`
    - `data-science`
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="By Product">
    Product-based naming:
    - `product-a`
    - `mobile-app`
    - `web-platform`
    - `api-team`
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="By Location">
    Location-based naming:
    - `us-west`
    - `emea`
    - `apac`
    - `remote`
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## What Happens After Creation

Once your team is created:

### 1. Team Structure

```
Team: engineering
├── Members
│   └── You (Owner)
├── Billing Account
│   ├── Type: team
│   ├── Tier: Pro ($10/month)
│   └── Credits: 10,000,000/month
├── API Keys
│   └── (None - create as needed)
└── Resources
    └── (None - add as needed)
```

### 2. Immediate Actions

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Invite Members" icon="user-plus">
    Add team members and assign roles

    Navigate to `/teams/[slug]/members`
  </Card>

  <Card title="Create API Keys" icon="key">
    Generate API keys for team services

    Navigate to `/teams/[slug]/api-keys`
  </Card>

  <Card title="Configure Settings" icon="gear">
    Update team name and preferences

    Navigate to `/teams/[slug]/settings`
  </Card>

  <Card title="Monitor Usage" icon="chart-line">
    Track team resource consumption

    Navigate to `/teams/[slug]/billing`
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 3. Team URLs

Your team is accessible at:

```
Dashboard: /teams/[slug]
Members: /teams/[slug]/members
API Keys: /teams/[slug]/api-keys
Billing: /teams/[slug]/billing
Settings: /teams/[slug]/settings
```

**Example** (slug: `engineering`):
```
/teams/engineering
/teams/engineering/members
/teams/engineering/api-keys
/teams/engineering/billing
/teams/engineering/settings
```

## Billing for Teams

### Teams

<ResponseField name="Subscription" type="string">
  **Team Pro**: $10/month
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Trial" type="string">
  **None** (trials only for personal accounts)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Included Credits" type="number">
  **10,000,000 credits** ($10 worth)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Payment" type="string">
  **Your payment method**
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Usage Charges" type="string">
  **Pay-as-you-go** for usage beyond included credits
</ResponseField>

## Troubleshooting

### Slug Already Taken

If your desired slug is unavailable:

1. **Try variations**:
   - Add numbers: `engineering-2`
   - Add organization: `acme-engineering`
   - Use abbreviations: `eng-team`

2. **Check availability**: The form will show if slug is taken

3. **Choose unique identifier**: Make it specific to your use case

### Payment Required Error

If you get a payment error:

1. **Configure payment method**: Set up payment in billing settings
2. **Check payment status**: Ensure payment method is valid
3. **Contact support**: If problem persists

### Billing Declined

If team creation fails due to billing:

1. **Verify payment method**: Check card details
2. **Check balance**: Ensure sufficient funds
3. **Try different card**: Use alternative payment method
4. **Contact bank**: Payment may be blocked
5. **Reach support**: Contact Delino support

## Team Limits


<ResponseField name="Members per Team" type="number">
  **Unlimited**

  No hard limit on team size
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="API Keys per Team" type="number">
  **Unlimited**

  Create as many API keys as needed
</ResponseField>
