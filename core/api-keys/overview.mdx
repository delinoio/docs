API keys (Personal Access Tokens) allow you to authenticate API requests without using your main account credentials. They provide secure, programmatic access to Delino services with fine-grained permission control.

## How API Keys Work

API keys are Personal Access Tokens (PATs) that provide a secure way to authenticate API requests. Each key has:

- **Unique Token**: A secure token value shown only once at creation
- **Display Name**: A user-friendly name you choose
- **Scopes**: Fine-grained permissions controlling what the key can access
- **Expiration**: Optional expiration date

## Permission Scopes

API keys use a scope-based permission system with the format: `service:resource:action`

### Scope Levels

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Full Access">
    Grant complete access to all services and operations.

    **Scope**: `["*"]`

    **Use case**: Development and testing environments
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Service-Level Access">
    Grant access to all operations within specific services.

    **Example**: `service:*` - All operations for a specific service

    **Use case**: Production applications using specific services
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Granular Access">
    Grant access to specific operations within services.

    **Examples**:
    - `service:resource:action` - Specific operation only
    - `appcore:payment:update` - Access billing portal only

    **Use case**: Maximum security with minimal permissions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Wildcard Support

Scopes support wildcards for flexible permission management:
- `*` - Full access to everything
- `service:*` - All operations in a service
- `service:resource:*` - All actions on a resource

### Available Scopes

**AppCore**:
- `appcore:payment:update` - Access billing portal URL
- `appcore:team:read` - Read team information
- `appcore:team:write` - Manage teams

For service-specific scopes, refer to each service's documentation.

## Security Features

### Token Security
- **One-Time Display**: Token value shown only at creation
- **Secure Storage**: Tokens stored securely
- **Scope Validation**: Every request validates required permissions

### Expiration
- **Optional Expiration**: Set expiration date or create non-expiring keys
- **Flexibility**: Choose the expiration that fits your security needs

## Common Use Cases

### Development Environment
```bash
# Create a key with full access for development
Scopes: ["*"]
Name: "Development - Local"
Expiration: 30 days
```

### Production Service
```bash
# Create a key with service-level access
Scopes: ["service:*"]
Name: "Production - Service Access"
Expiration: Never
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```bash
# Create a key with specific permissions
Scopes: ["service:resource:write"]
Name: "GitHub Actions - Main Pipeline"
Expiration: 1 year
```

### Billing Portal Access
```bash
# Create a key for billing management
Scopes: ["appcore:payment:update"]
Name: "Finance Tool - Billing Portal"
Expiration: Never
```
