API keys allow you to securely authenticate and integrate with the Delino platform programmatically.

## Prerequisites

- Active Delino account
- Appropriate permissions to create API keys in your team

## Creating a new API key

1. Navigate to the API Keys page by clicking **API Keys** in the left sidebar
2. Click the **New Key** button in the top-right corner
3. Configure your API key settings:
   - Enter a descriptive name for the key
   - Set appropriate permissions and scopes
4. Click **Create** to generate the key

<Warning>
Copy and store your API key immediately after creation. For security reasons, you won't be able to view the full key again.
</Warning>

## Managing your API keys

You can view and manage all your API keys at:
- Personal account: [https://app.delino.io/en/teams/~/api-keys](https://app.delino.io/en/teams/~/api-keys)

From this page, you can:
- View all active API keys
- Revoke keys that are no longer needed
- Monitor key usage and last activity

## Best practices

- Use descriptive names that indicate the key's purpose
- Create separate keys for different applications or environments
- Rotate keys regularly for enhanced security
- Revoke unused or compromised keys immediately
- Never share keys in public repositories or client-side code
