Proper API key management is essential for maintaining security and access control. This guide covers viewing, monitoring, and revoking your API keys.

## Viewing API Keys

Navigate to the API Keys page for your account:
- **Personal Account**: `/teams/~/api-keys`
- **Team Account**: `/teams/[team-slug]/api-keys`

### Key Information Displayed

Each API key shows the following information:

<ResponseField name="Name" type="string">
  The display name you chose when creating the key
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Key Value" type="string">
  Masked token value (e.g., `deli_****...****abcd`)

  <Info>The full token is only shown once at creation time</Info>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Permissions" type="string">
  Summary of scopes assigned to the key:
  - "Full Access" for `["*"]`
  - "X services" for service-level access
  - "X scopes" for granular permissions

  Click to view detailed scope list
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Created" type="timestamp">
  When the key was created
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Last Used" type="date">
  When the key was last used

  <Note>Helps identify unused keys for cleanup</Note>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Expires" type="date">
  Expiration date (or "Never" if no expiration)
</ResponseField>

## Monitoring Usage

### Last Used Timestamp

The "Last Used" column updates whenever the API key successfully authenticates a request. This helps you:

- **Identify Active Keys**: See which keys are actively in use
- **Detect Unused Keys**: Find keys that haven't been used recently
- **Security Auditing**: Track key usage patterns
- **Cleanup Planning**: Identify candidates for revocation

<Tip>
Review the "Last Used" column monthly to identify and remove unused keys.
</Tip>

### Permission Details

Click on any key's permission summary to view the complete list of scopes:

```
Full Access
├── * (all services and operations)

2 services
├── service-a:*
└── service-b:*

3 scopes
├── service:resource:read
├── service:resource:write
└── appcore:payment:update
```

## Revoking API Keys

<Warning>
Revoking an API key is **permanent and immediate**. Any applications using the key will lose access immediately.
</Warning>

### How to Revoke

1. Navigate to the API Keys page
2. Find the key you want to revoke
3. Click the **Delete** button (trash icon)
4. Confirm the deletion

The key is immediately revoked and can no longer be used for authentication.

### When to Revoke

Revoke keys in these situations:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Key Compromise">
    If a key has been exposed or leaked:
    1. Immediately revoke the compromised key
    2. Create a new key with the same permissions
    3. Update your applications with the new key
    4. Review recent usage for suspicious activity
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Unused Keys">
    If a key hasn't been used in a long time:
    1. Verify the key is truly unused
    2. Check with your team if it's a team key
    3. Revoke the key to reduce attack surface
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Project Decommissioned">
    When a project or service is retired:
    1. Document which keys were used
    2. Revoke all associated keys
    3. Remove keys from any documentation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Team Member Departure">
    When a team member leaves:
    1. Review keys created by the member
    2. Revoke personal keys if applicable
    3. Rotate shared keys they had access to
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Rotation">
    As part of security best practices:
    1. Create new keys with same permissions
    2. Update applications with new keys
    3. Revoke old keys after verification
    4. Document rotation date
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Key Rotation

Key rotation is a security best practice that involves regularly replacing API keys.

### Rotation Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create New Key">
    Generate a new API key with the same scopes as the old key

    ```bash
    Name: "Production - Image Processing v2"
    Scopes: Same as old key
    Expiration: 1 year (or same as old key)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Applications">
    Update your applications to use the new key

    ```bash
    # Example: Update environment variable
    export DELINO_API_KEY="deli_new_key_value"

    # Restart services
    systemctl restart myapp
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test New Key">
    Verify the new key works correctly

    ```bash
    # Test API call with new key
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer deli_new_key_value" \
      https://api.delino.io/...
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Old Key">
    Wait 24-48 hours and monitor "Last Used" timestamp

    If old key is still being used:
    - Identify which service is using it
    - Update that service
    - Wait and verify again
  </Step>

  <Step title="Revoke Old Key">
    Once confirmed the old key is no longer used:
    1. Revoke the old key
    2. Monitor for any errors
    3. Document the rotation
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Rotation Schedule

Recommended rotation frequencies:

| Environment | Frequency | Reason |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Development | 30-90 days | Frequent changes, lower risk |
| Staging | 60-180 days | Balance of security and stability |
| Production | 90-365 days | Stability critical, planned rotations |
| CI/CD | 60-180 days | Automated environments easier to update |

<Note>
These are recommendations. Adjust based on your organization's security policies.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Key Not Working

If an API key stops working:

1. **Check Expiration**: Verify the key hasn't expired
2. **Verify Scopes**: Ensure the key has required permissions
3. **Test Authentication**: Try a simple API call
4. **Check Last Used**: See if it's being used at all
5. **Review Logs**: Check application logs for error messages

### Permission Denied

If you get permission errors:

1. **Review Scopes**: Check the key's scope list
2. **Verify Endpoint**: Ensure the endpoint matches a scope
3. **Check Wildcards**: Understand wildcard coverage
4. **Contact Support**: If scope seems correct but fails

### Cannot Delete Key

If you cannot delete a key:

1. **Check Permissions**: Ensure you have admin rights
2. **Verify Ownership**: Confirm the key belongs to your account
3. **Try Again**: Temporary network issues may occur
