Delino uses a transparent, credit-based billing system for payment processing. This guide covers subscription tiers, billing cycles, and how credits work.

## Billing System

### Credit-Based Model

Delino uses a credit system for precise usage tracking:

<ResponseField name="Conversion Rate" type="number">
  **$1 USD = 1,000,000 credits**

  All internal calculations use credits for precision, with conversion to USD only at invoice generation.
</ResponseField>

**Examples**:
```
$0.001 USD = 1,000 credits
$0.01 USD = 10,000 credits
$0.10 USD = 100,000 credits
$1.00 USD = 1,000,000 credits
$10.00 USD = 10,000,000 credits
```

### Why Credits?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Precision">
    Credits allow for sub-cent pricing without floating-point errors

    Example: 150 credits = $0.00015 USD (precise to 6 decimals)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance">
    Integer arithmetic is faster and more reliable than decimal calculations

    All database operations use bigint for credits
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consistency">
    No rounding errors or currency conversion issues

    Credits are the single source of truth for billing
