## Viewing Current Usage

### Dashboard Access

View your current billing cycle usage:
- **Personal Account**: `/teams/~/billing`
- **Team Account**: `/teams/[team-slug]/billing`

### Usage Display

<ResponseField name="Current Period" type="date range">
  Billing cycle start and end dates

  **Example**: Sep 15, 2024 - Oct 14, 2024
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Credits Used" type="number">
  Total credits consumed this cycle

  **Format**: `1,234,567 credits`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Amount (USD)" type="number">
  Equivalent amount in USD

  **Calculation**: `credits / 1,000,000`

  **Example**: `1,234,567 credits = $1.23 USD`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Included Credits" type="number">
  Credits included in Pro subscription

  **Pro Tier**: 10,000,000 credits ($10)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Additional Charges" type="number">
  Usage beyond included credits

  **Calculation**: `(used_credits - included_credits) / 1,000,000`

  **Example**:
  ```
  Used: 15,000,000 credits
  Included: 10,000,000 credits
  Additional: 5,000,000 credits = $5.00 USD
  ```
</ResponseField>
