## PR stuck in draft

**Symptoms:**
- PR remains in draft status
- All checks passing but not ready for review
- Cannot merge PR

**Solution:**
1. Check CI status - ensure all checks are passing
2. Verify auto-undraft is enabled in [Settings](/autodev/settings/index)
3. Manually undraft the PR if needed
4. Check if there are pending review comments

## AutoDev not responding to reviews

**Symptoms:**
- Reviewer submitted feedback
- No workflow triggered
- PR not updated
- PR not converting to draft
- No response to feedback

**Possible causes:**
- Reviewer hasn't connected the repository in AutoDev
- Bot reviews with auto-apply disabled
- GitHub webhook not configured or delivery failing
- Review was a simple approval (doesn't trigger workflow)
- Review type doesn't trigger workflow
- Repository not connected

**Solution:**

**Ensure reviewer has repository access:**
1. Reviewer must connect the repository in AutoDev
2. Verify repository appears in reviewer's dashboard
3. Check that AutoDev GitHub App is installed

**Enable auto-apply for bot reviews:**
1. Go to Settings
2. Enable "Auto-apply Bot Reviews"
3. Bot reviews will now trigger workflows

**Verify webhook configuration:**
1. Repository settings â†’ Webhooks
2. Check AutoDev webhook exists
3. Verify webhook is active
4. Check recent delivery status

**Check GitHub webhook logs:**
1. Go to repository settings on GitHub
2. Navigate to Webhooks
3. Find AutoDev webhook
4. Check recent deliveries for errors
5. Redeliver failed webhooks if needed

**Check review type:**
- Simple approvals don't trigger workflows
- Comments must be submitted with "Request changes" or "Comment"
- Verify review was actually submitted (not just comment)

**Manual trigger:**
1. Go to task details
2. Click "Update PR"
3. Enter update instructions
4. Workflow will trigger manually

## CI fixes not working

**Symptoms:**
- CI checks failing
- AutoDev not attempting fixes
- PR remains with failed checks

**Possible causes:**
- Already attempted fix for this commit (rate limited)
- Workflow execution failed
- GitHub Actions quota exceeded
- AutoDev webhook not receiving check events

**Solution:**

**Push new commit to allow new fix attempt:**
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger CI fix attempt"
git push
```

**Check workflow execution logs:**
1. Go to task details page
2. Find workflow executions
3. Look for "ci_fix" type workflows
4. Review error messages

**Verify GitHub Actions quota:**
1. Check repository Actions tab
2. Verify workflows can run
3. Check organization billing if quota exceeded

**Manual fix alternative:**
1. Review CI failure logs
2. Make fixes locally
3. Push updates to PR branch

## Too many automated updates

**Symptoms:**
- PR receives excessive updates
- Multiple workflow runs
- High costs
- Reviewers confused by constant changes

**Causes:**
- Task prompt too vague
- Review feedback unclear
- Multiple bots triggering updates
- CI checks failing repeatedly

**Solution:**

**Break tasks into smaller units:**
- Create focused, single-purpose tasks
- Avoid complex multi-step tasks
- Use composite tasks for large projects

**Be more specific in initial prompt:**
```
Good: Fix null pointer exception in UserService.authenticateUser()
when email field is missing

Bad: Fix the bug
```

**Manually review and update PRs:**
1. Disable auto-apply temporarily
2. Review accumulated feedback
3. Make consolidated updates
4. Re-enable auto-apply

**Limit bot reviews:**
1. Configure bots to review less frequently
2. Adjust bot sensitivity
3. Use auto-apply selectively
