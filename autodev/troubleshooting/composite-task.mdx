This guide helps you troubleshoot common issues with composite tasks and task graph execution in AutoDev.

## Planning Phase Issues

### Planning Stuck or Takes Too Long

**Symptoms:**
- Composite task stuck in "Planning" status
- Planning workflow running for 30+ minutes
- No task graph generated

**Possible Causes:**
1. Complex project requiring extensive planning
2. Vague or unclear prompt
3. Workflow timeout
4. AI agent error

**Solutions:**

**Check planning workflow status:**
1. Go to GitHub Actions
2. Find the planning workflow run
3. Check logs for errors or stuck steps

**Simplify the prompt:**
- Break very large projects into smaller composite tasks
- Be more specific about requirements
- Provide clear scope boundaries

**Retry planning:**
1. Delete the composite task
2. Create new task with refined prompt
3. Monitor planning progress

### No Plan Generated

**Symptoms:**
- Planning completes but no task graph appears
- Status changes from "Planning" to "Failed"
- Error: "Failed to generate plan"

**Solutions:**

**Check planning workflow logs:**
```
Look for:
- "Generating task graph..."
- Plan file creation
- Upload errors
```

**Verify prompt is actionable:**
- Does it describe a concrete project?
- Are requirements clear?
- Is scope reasonable for AI planning?

**Example good prompts:**
```
Build a REST API for user management with
authentication, CRUD operations, and testing
```

**Example problematic prompts:**
```
Make the app better
Build something cool
```

### Invalid Task Graph

**Symptoms:**
- Plan uploaded but status shows "Failed"
- Error: "Invalid task graph structure"
- Circular dependencies detected

**Causes:**
- AI generated invalid DAG structure
- Circular dependencies in plan
- Missing required fields

**Solutions:**

**This is rare - usually indicates:**
- Very complex/unclear requirements
- Edge case in planning algorithm

**Retry with clearer prompt:**
1. Delete failed composite task
2. Simplify project description
3. Break into smaller composite tasks
4. Create new task

## Task Graph Execution Issues

### No Tasks Marked as Ready

**Symptoms:**
- Clicked "Start Execution"
- Status is "In Progress"
- But no tasks show as "Ready"
- Nothing happens

**Causes:**
- All nodes have dependencies (no starting point)
- Graph structure issue
- Status calculation error

**Solutions:**

**Use Sync feature:**
1. Composite task details page
2. Click "Sync Composite Task"
3. System recalculates node statuses
4. Initial nodes should become ready

**Check task graph visualization:**
- Are there nodes without dependencies?
- These should be ready first
- If all nodes have dependencies, graph is invalid

### Tasks Not Becoming Ready

**Symptoms:**
- Some tasks completed
- But dependent tasks not marked as ready
- Tasks stuck in "Pending" or "Blocked"

**Solutions:**

**Sync composite task:**
1. Go to composite task details
2. Click "Sync Composite Task"
3. System checks dependencies
4. Updates node readiness

**What Sync does:**
- Checks all task PRs in GitHub
- Updates merge statuses
- Recalculates dependencies
- Marks ready nodes

**Check dependency completion:**
- All dependencies must be "Completed"
- If any dependency "Failed", node is "Blocked"
- Review failed dependencies

### Cannot Approve Task

**Symptoms:**
- Task shows as "Ready"
- Approve button doesn't work
- Error when trying to approve

**Solutions:**

**Check task status is "Ready":**
- Only ready tasks can be approved
- Pending/blocked tasks cannot be approved

**Verify you own the composite task:**
- Only the user who created it can approve nodes
- Check you're logged in correctly

**Refresh the page:**
- Status may have changed
- Reload to get latest state

**Sync composite task:**
- Updates all task statuses
- Resolves state inconsistencies

## Auto-Approval Issues

### Auto-Approval Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Auto-approval enabled
- Tasks become ready
- But not automatically approved/executed

**Solutions:**

**Verify auto-approval is enabled:**
1. Go to composite task details
2. Check "Auto-Approval" toggle is ON
3. Re-enable if needed

**Sync to trigger auto-approval:**
1. Click "Sync Composite Task"
2. System detects ready tasks
3. Auto-approves if enabled
4. Spawns unit tasks

**Check for errors:**
- Review composite task logs
- Look for auto-approval failures
- Verify repository connection

### Want to Disable Auto-Approval

**How to disable mid-execution:**
1. Go to composite task details
2. Toggle "Auto-Approval" to OFF
3. Future ready tasks won't auto-execute
4. Currently running tasks continue

**Note:**
- Already approved tasks continue running
- Only affects tasks that haven't been approved yet

## Task Node Management

### Cannot Edit Task Prompt

**Symptoms:**
- Want to modify task prompt
- Edit button disabled or missing
- Changes don't save

**Possible Causes:**
- Task is in wrong status for editing
- Don't have permission
- Task already executing

**Solutions:**

**Check task status:**
- Can edit: `pending`, `ready`, `blocked`
- Cannot edit: `approved`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `failed`

**For approved tasks:**
- Cannot edit (already executing)
- Cancel spawned unit task if needed
- Retry the node after failure

**For completed/failed tasks:**
- Cannot edit completed work
- Can retry failed tasks
- Retry creates new unit task

### Retry Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Click "Retry" on failed task
- Nothing happens
- Task remains failed

**Solutions:**

**Check if task is actually failed:**
- Status must be "Failed" or "Approved"
- Can only retry these statuses

**Verify associated unit task:**
- Failed nodes have spawned tasks
- Check unit task status
- May need to delete unit task first

**Sync before retry:**
1. Sync composite task
2. Verifies current state
3. Then retry the node

### Node Stuck in "Approved" Status

**Symptoms:**
- Approved a task
- Status is "Approved"
- But no unit task spawned
- Stays approved indefinitely

**Causes:**
- Unit task creation failed
- System error during spawn
- Connection issue

**Solutions:**

**Retry the node:**
1. Click retry on the approved node
2. Creates new unit task
3. Monitors execution

**Check error logs:**
- Look for task spawn errors
- Verify repository connection
- Check workflow execution permissions

**Sync composite task:**
- May resolve status issues
- Updates task relationships

## Prompt and Context Issues

### Tasks Don't Build on Previous Work

**Symptoms:**
- Later tasks don't reference earlier PRs
- Work is duplicated
- Missing context from dependencies

**Cause:**
- System should automatically include PR references
- May be a timing issue

**Solutions:**

**Ensure dependencies are completed:**
- Wait for dependency PRs to merge
- System includes PR numbers in prompts
- Later tasks reference completed work

**Manual context in prompt edit:**
When approving a task, edit prompt to add:
```
Reference the work completed in PR #123 and PR #456.
Build upon the authentication system from those PRs.
```

**Check dependency PRs are merged:**
- Dependencies should complete before children
- Merged PRs provide context
- Open PRs may not provide enough context

### AI Misunderstands Task Context

**Symptoms:**
- Generated code doesn't align with plan
- Task seems unrelated to project
- Wrong approach taken

**Solutions:**

**Edit prompt before approval:**
1. When task becomes ready
2. Click "Edit Prompt"
3. Add specific context:
   ```
   Continue the work from the database setup task.
   Use the User model defined in PR #123.
   Follow patterns in @src/models/
   ```

**Provide file references:**
```
Update @src/services/auth.ts to use the new
JWT tokens from the authentication task.
```

**Request changes via review:**
- After PR is created
- Leave specific guidance
- AutoDev will update

## Dependency and Blocking Issues

### Task Blocked by Failed Dependency

**Symptoms:**
- Task shows "Blocked" status
- Dependency task failed
- Cannot proceed

**Solutions:**

**Fix the failed dependency:**
1. Navigate to failed dependency task
2. Review what went wrong
3. Retry the failed task
4. Once it completes, blocked task becomes ready

**Or modify the graph:**
- Delete the blocked task (if not needed)
- Create new unit task as workaround
- Manually complete the work

### Circular Dependency Detected

**Symptoms:**
- Some tasks never become ready
- Mutual dependencies
- Graph seems stuck

**This shouldn't happen:**
- Planning should prevent this
- DAG validation should catch it

**If it does occur:**
1. Report to support with task details
2. Delete composite task
3. Create new task with clearer prompt
4. System will generate valid DAG

## Sync Feature Issues

### Sync Operation Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Click "Sync Composite Task"
- Error message appears
- No updates occur

**Solutions:**

**Check repository connection:**
1. Verify repository is connected
2. Check GitHub App is installed
3. Reconnect if needed

**Try again:**
- Temporary GitHub API issues
- Wait a few minutes
- Retry sync operation

**Check permissions:**
- Must have repository access
- GitHub App needs permissions
- Verify in repository settings

### Sync Shows Wrong Results

**Symptoms:**
- Sync completes
- But task statuses still wrong
- PRs not reflecting correctly

**What to check:**

**PR merge status in GitHub:**
1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Check actual PR status
3. Compare with AutoDev display

**Wait for GitHub API:**
- GitHub webhooks may be delayed
- Wait 1-2 minutes
- Retry sync

**Force refresh:**
1. Sync composite task
2. Refresh browser page
3. Check updated statuses

## Performance Issues

### Composite Task Very Slow

**Symptoms:**
- Taking days to complete
- Many tasks waiting
- Progress is slow

**Causes:**
1. Sequential dependencies
2. Waiting for approvals
3. Long-running unit tasks

**Solutions:**

**Enable auto-approval:**
- Eliminates approval delays
- Tasks execute immediately when ready
- Faster overall completion

**Review task graph structure:**
- Too many sequential dependencies?
- Could some tasks be parallel?
- May need better planning

**For future tasks:**
- Provide better context in prompt
- AI will optimize parallelization
- Reduce sequential dependencies

### Too Many Nodes

**Symptoms:**
- Composite task created 50+ nodes
- Overwhelming to manage
- Many small tasks

**Cause:**
- AI over-decomposed the project
- Prompt was too broad

**Solutions:**

**For current task:**
- Enable auto-approval to reduce management
- Let it run automatically
- Monitor progress

**For future tasks:**
- Be more specific about scope
- Request specific number of major steps
- Example: "Break this into 5-8 major tasks"

## Deleting and Canceling

### Cannot Delete Composite Task

**Symptoms:**
- Delete button disabled
- Error when trying to delete
- Task remains

**Solutions:**

**Check for running tasks:**
- Running unit tasks prevent deletion
- Wait for completion
- Or cancel unit tasks first

**Force delete process:**
1. Delete composite task
2. System cancels incomplete unit tasks
3. Blocks all pending nodes
4. Removes composite task

**Verify permissions:**
- Only creator can delete
- Check correct user is logged in

### Partial Deletion Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Composite task deleted
- But some unit tasks remain
- PRs still open

**This is expected:**
- Unit tasks are preserved for history
- PRs remain open (you can close manually)
- Task graph is removed

**To clean up:**
1. Close remaining PRs on GitHub
2. Review unit task history if needed
3. Unit tasks show as "Cancelled"

## Status Display Issues

### Status Shows Incorrect Progress

**Symptoms:**
- Progress shows "3/10 completed"
- But more tasks actually done
- Counts don't match

**Solutions:**

**Sync composite task:**
- Recalculates progress
- Updates node counts
- Fixes display

**What affects count:**
- Only "Completed" nodes count
- Failed nodes don't count as complete
- In-progress nodes don't count yet

### Task Graph Visualization Not Loading

**Symptoms:**
- Graph diagram doesn't appear
- Shows loading spinner forever
- Blank visualization area

**Solutions:**

**Refresh the page:**
- Browser cache issue
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Check browser console:**
- Open dev tools (F12)
- Look for JavaScript errors
- Report if errors found

**Try different browser:**
- Temporary browser issue
- Test in Chrome/Firefox/Safari

## Prevention and Best Practices

### Writing Better Prompts

**Include project structure:**
```
Build a blogging platform with:
1. Backend API (Node.js + Express)
2. Database (PostgreSQL)
3. Frontend (React)
4. Authentication (JWT)
5. Deployment (Docker)
```

**Specify technical stack:**
```
Use TypeScript, follow REST API best practices,
include unit tests, and set up CI/CD.
```

**Define clear boundaries:**
```
Only include core CRUD operations.
Do not include admin panel or analytics.
Focus on MVP functionality.
```

### Monitoring Progress

**Use auto-approval wisely:**
- Enable for trusted, well-defined tasks
- Disable for complex/critical work
- Monitor execution regularly

**Review task graph regularly:**
- Check for blocked nodes
- Identify failed dependencies
- Keep tasks moving forward

**Sync periodically:**
- Ensures accurate status
- Catches missed updates
- Prevents stuck states

### Managing Complexity

**Start smaller:**
- First composite task: 5-8 nodes
- Build confidence
- Scale up gradually

**Break mega-projects:**
- Don't try to build entire app in one task
- Create multiple composite tasks
- Each for a major feature/milestone

**Monitor costs:**
- Composite tasks can be expensive
- Each node = separate workflow execution
- Plan accordingly
