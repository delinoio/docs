Unit tasks are AutoDev's building blocks for straightforward development work. Each unit task focuses on a single objective and can generate multiple pull requests to complete it.

## Creating a unit task

1. Navigate to your AutoDev dashboard
2. Select your repository from the dropdown
3. Enter your task description in the prompt field
4. **Leave "Create as Composite Task" unchecked** for unit tasks
5. (Optional) Configure advanced settings:
   - AI Agent: Choose your preferred AI coding agent
   - Model Version: Specify the model version
   - Base Branch: Choose the branch to work from
6. Click **Create Task**

## Task lifecycle

### 1. Pending
Your task is created and queued for execution. AutoDev prepares to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow.

### 2. In Progress
The AI agent is actively working on your task:
- Analyzing your requirements
- Writing code
- Creating pull requests
- Running tests

### 3. Completed
The task is marked complete when all pull requests are merged. This means:
- All code changes have been reviewed and approved
- All PRs have been merged to their target branches
- The task objectives have been successfully implemented

### 4. Failed
The task encountered an error. Common reasons:
- GitHub Actions workflow failed
- Invalid configuration
- AI agent encountered an issue

You can retry failed tasks from the task details page.

## Task details page

The task details page shows:

### Task overview
- Task title (automatically generated from your prompt)
- Original prompt
- Repository and branch information
- Current status
- Creation timestamp

### Pull requests
All PRs created for this task:
- PR title and number
- Status (open/closed/merged)
- CI check results
- Review comment count
- Links to GitHub

### Workflow executions
History of all workflow runs:
- Execution status (pending/in_progress/completed/failed)
- Type (task creation, PR update, review response, CI fix)
- Timestamps
- GitHub Actions run link
- Retry button for failed executions

## Managing pull requests

### Automatic PR comments
When a PR is created, AutoDev adds two types of comments:

**Task link comment** (always added):
- Links back to the AutoDev task
- Provides context for reviewers

**Task prompt comment** (optional, enabled by default):
- Shows the original task prompt
- Helps reviewers understand the AI's instructions
- Can be disabled in [Settings](/autodev/settings)

### PR workflow

1. **PR Creation** - AI creates PR and opens it for review
2. **Draft Status** - PR is converted to draft during automated updates
3. **Code Review** - Team members review the changes
4. **AI Responds** - AutoDev automatically responds to review comments
5. **CI Checks** - Automated tests run
6. **CI Fixes** - AutoDev fixes failing checks automatically
7. **Ready to Merge** - PR is undrafted when all checks pass

## Updating a pull request

You can manually request updates to any PR:

1. Go to the task details page
2. Find the PR you want to update
3. Click **Update PR**
4. Enter your update instructions
5. AutoDev converts the PR to draft and makes the changes

## Retrying a task

If a task fails, you can retry it:

1. Go to the task details page
2. Click **Retry Task** in the workflow executions section
3. The task will re-execute with the same configuration

## Syncing task status

Use the sync feature to refresh task status from GitHub:

1. Go to the task details page
2. Click **Sync Task** in the Debug menu
3. AutoDev checks all PRs and updates the task status automatically:
   - **All PRs merged** → Task marked as completed
   - **All PRs closed without merge** → Task marked as failed
   - **PRs still open** → Status remains in progress

## Deleting a task

Deleting a task:
- Closes all open pull requests
- Cancels any running workflows
- Removes the task from your dashboard

**Note**: This action cannot be undone.

## Best practices

### Write clear prompts
Be specific about what you want:

**Good prompts:**
```
Fix the null pointer exception in UserService.java when email is missing
```
```
Add rate limiting to the /api/auth endpoint with 10 requests per minute
```
```
Update the user profile page to show avatar upload with preview
```

**Avoid vague prompts:**
```
Fix the bug
```
```
Make it better
```
```
Update the code
```

### Include context
Reference specific files, functions, or error messages:
```
Fix the CORS error on line 45 of server.js when calling from localhost:3000
```

### Use file references
Include file paths with `@` for better AI understanding:
```
Refactor @src/services/payment.ts to use the new PaymentProcessor interface
```

### Specify requirements
Include technical requirements or constraints:
```
Add user authentication using JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration,
stored in httpOnly cookies
```

### Break down large tasks
For complex work, consider using [Composite Tasks](/autodev/tasks/composite) or creating multiple unit tasks.
