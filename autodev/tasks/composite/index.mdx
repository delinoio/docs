Composite tasks use AI to break down complex projects into multiple coordinated steps. AutoDev creates a task graph showing dependencies and execution order, allowing parallel work while ensuring tasks build on each other correctly.

## How composite tasks work

### 1. AI Planning Phase
When you create a composite task:
- AutoDev analyzes your request
- AI generates a task graph (DAG structure)
- Tasks are organized with dependencies
- Plan is saved for your review

Status: **Planning**

### 2. Review and Start
After planning completes:
- View the task graph visualization
- See all tasks and their dependencies
- Review the execution plan
- Click **Start Execution** to begin

Status: **Pending** → **In Progress**

### 3. Task Execution
Tasks execute based on dependencies:
- Initial tasks (no dependencies) become **Ready**
- You approve each ready task
- Approved tasks spawn unit tasks
- Tasks run in parallel when possible
- New tasks become ready as dependencies complete

### 4. Completion
When all tasks finish:
- Composite task status: **Completed**
- All pull requests are created

## Creating a composite task

1. Go to your AutoDev dashboard
2. Select your repository
3. Enter your complex project description
4. **Check "Create as Composite Task"**
5. (Optional) Configure defaults for all tasks:
   - AI Agent: Default agent for all nodes
   - Model Version: Default model for all nodes
   - Base Branch: Branch for all tasks
6. Click **Create Task**

## Task graph structure

The task graph shows:

### Nodes
Each node represents a task to be completed:
- **Pending** (gray) - Waiting for dependencies
- **Ready** (blue) - Dependencies met, awaiting approval
- **Approved** (yellow) - Approved, about to start
- **In Progress** (orange) - Currently executing
- **Completed** (green) - Successfully finished
- **Failed** (red) - Encountered an error
- **Blocked** (dark gray) - Cannot proceed due to failed dependency

### Edges
Arrows show dependencies:
- Task A → Task B means B depends on A
- Task B starts only after Task A completes

### Parallel execution
Tasks without dependencies on each other run in parallel:
```
    Task A
   /      \
Task B    Task C  (B and C run in parallel)
   \      /
    Task D        (D waits for both B and C)
```

## Approving tasks

When a task becomes ready:

1. Review the task's auto-generated prompt
2. (Optional) Modify the prompt before approving
3. Click **Approve** to start execution
4. Task spawns a unit task and begins work

### Auto-approval mode

Enable auto-approval to run tasks automatically:

1. Go to composite task details
2. Enable **Auto-Approval**
3. Ready tasks are automatically approved and executed
4. No manual intervention required

Use auto-approval when:
- You trust the AI-generated plan
- Tasks are well-defined and low-risk
- You want continuous progress without manual steps

Disable auto-approval when:
- You want to review each task before execution
- Tasks require careful sequencing
- You want to modify prompts before execution

## Managing composite tasks

### Task details page

View comprehensive information:

**Overview section:**
- Title and description
- Repository and branch
- Progress (X/Y tasks completed)
- Current status
- Creation time

**Task graph visualization:**
- Interactive diagram of all tasks
- Color-coded status indicators
- Click nodes to see details
- View dependencies

**Ready for approval:**
- List of tasks ready to execute
- Option to modify prompts
- Approve or reject buttons

**Active tasks:**
- Currently executing tasks
- Links to spawned unit tasks
- Real-time status

**Completed tasks:**
- Finished tasks
- Links to pull requests
- Merge status

**Failed/blocked tasks:**
- Failed tasks with error details
- Retry options
- Blocked tasks showing required dependencies

### Editing task prompts

You can edit task prompts before execution:

**During approval:**
1. Task becomes ready
2. Review the AI-generated prompt
3. Click **Edit Prompt**
4. Make your changes
5. Approve to execute with modified prompt

**Before approval:**
1. Go to task graph visualization
2. Click on a task node (must be pending, ready, or blocked)
3. Edit the prompt and title
4. Save changes
5. Approve when ready

**Note**: You cannot edit prompts for tasks that are approved, in progress, completed, or failed.

### Retrying failed tasks

If a task fails:

1. Review the error details
2. (Optional) Edit the task prompt
3. Click **Retry**
4. A new unit task is created with the same (or updated) configuration

### Syncing composite tasks

The sync feature checks all tasks and updates statuses:

1. Go to composite task details
2. Click **Sync Composite Task**
3. AutoDev checks all tasks and PRs:
   - Updates PR merge statuses from GitHub
   - Marks completed tasks when PRs are merged
   - Recalculates node readiness
   - Triggers auto-approval if enabled
   - Updates composite task progress

Returns:
- Tasks updated count
- Nodes updated count
- PRs synced count
- Workflows triggered count

## Task graph best practices

### How AI creates the plan

AutoDev uses advanced prompting to create efficient task graphs:

**Planning priorities:**
1. **Minimize rebasing** - Structure for parallel execution
2. **CI/Infrastructure first** - Set up testing before features
3. **Independent code paths** - Tasks touch different files
4. **Clear boundaries** - Define interfaces early

**Task ordering:**
- Phase 1: CI/Infrastructure (no dependencies)
- Phase 2: Database/Storage setup
- Phase 3: Core contracts (APIs, models)
- Phase 4: Parallel features
- Phase 5: Integration
- Phase 6: Polish (UI, performance, docs)

**Graph structure:**
- Wide and shallow (more parallel, fewer sequential)
- Each task represents meaningful progress

### Writing effective composite task prompts

**Include comprehensive context:**
```
Build a complete e-commerce checkout system including:
- Shopping cart with session persistence
- Payment processing with Stripe integration
- Order confirmation emails
- Admin order management dashboard
- Inventory updates after purchase
```

**Specify technical requirements:**
```
Migrate to microservices architecture using:
- Docker containers for each service
- API Gateway with Kong
- Event bus with RabbitMQ
- Shared PostgreSQL database
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
```

**Reference documentation:**
```
Implement authentication following our architecture:
- Reference: @docs/auth-architecture.md
- Use our existing JWT library
- Follow security guidelines in @SECURITY.md
```

## Deleting composite tasks

Deleting a composite task:

1. Cancels all incomplete unit tasks
2. Blocks all pending/ready task nodes
3. Cancels running GitHub Actions workflows
4. Removes the composite task

**Note**: This action cannot be undone. Unit tasks are cancelled but preserved for history.

## Example composite task

**Prompt:**
```
Build a user authentication system with email verification and OAuth
```

**Generated task graph:**

```
1. Setup CI/CD pipeline
   ↓
2. Create database schema and migrations
   ↓
   ├→ 3. Implement email authentication
   │     ├→ User registration
   │     ├→ Email verification
   │     └→ Password reset
   │
   ├→ 4. Implement OAuth integration
   │     ├→ Google OAuth
   │     ├→ GitHub OAuth
   │     └→ OAuth callback handling
   │
   └→ 5. Build frontend components
         ├→ Login/register forms
         ├→ OAuth buttons
         └→ Email verification UI
   ↓
6. Integration tests and documentation
```

Tasks 3, 4, and 5 run in parallel after task 2 completes.

## Benefits of composite tasks

### Coordinated execution
- Tasks build on each other
- Dependencies ensure correct order
- Parallel work speeds completion

### AI-powered planning
- Optimal task breakdown
- Smart dependency management
- Efficient parallelization

### Flexibility
- Modify prompts before execution
- Retry failed tasks
- Enable/disable auto-approval

### Visibility
- See entire project plan upfront
- Track progress across all tasks
- Understand dependencies

### Batch processing with consistent prompts

Composite tasks excel at applying the same logic across multiple independent items, creating separate PRs for each one. This is ideal for:

**Translation and localization:**
```
Review all AutoDev documentation pages one by one and fix awkward translations.
Check each supported language individually.
Create one PR per page. Only create PRs if translations need fixing.
```

AutoDev will:
- Plan separate tasks for each documentation page
- Apply the same review logic to each language version
- Create individual PRs only when improvements are needed
- Process pages in parallel for faster completion

**Codebase-wide refactoring:**
```
Update all API endpoints to use the new authentication middleware.
Create one PR per endpoint group.
Ensure backward compatibility in each change.
```

**Systematic improvements:**
```
Add error handling to all database query functions.
Create one PR per module.
Include tests for each error case.
```

**Security audits and testing:**
```
Review each RPC method one by one, checking for security issues and adding tests.
Create one PR per RPC method.
If tests are already comprehensive, skip creating a PR for that method.
```

AutoDev will:
- Plan separate tasks for each RPC method
- Conduct security review and add tests for each one
- Create PRs only when improvements are needed
- Process methods independently for cleaner review

**Tip:** Requesting "one PR per item" helps create focused, reviewable changes rather than one massive PR with all changes combined.

This approach allows you to describe the logic once and let AutoDev apply it systematically across many items, while maintaining clean, reviewable PRs for each change.

## When not to use composite tasks

Use unit tasks instead when:
- Task is straightforward and single-purpose
- No dependencies on other work
- Quick fix or small change
- One pull request is sufficient
