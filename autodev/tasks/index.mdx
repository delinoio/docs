---

AutoDev offers two types of tasks to handle different development scenarios: **Unit Tasks** for straightforward work and **Composite Tasks** for complex projects.

## Unit Tasks

Unit tasks are perfect for single, well-defined development tasks. When you create a unit task, AutoDev's AI agent:

1. Analyzes your request
2. Writes the necessary code
3. Creates one or more pull requests
4. Responds to code reviews automatically
5. Fixes any CI failures

### When to use unit tasks

- **Bug fixes** - Fix a specific bug or issue
- **Small features** - Add a single, straightforward feature
- **Refactoring** - Improve code structure in a focused area
- **Documentation** - Update or create documentation
- **Quick updates** - Make targeted changes to existing code

### Example unit tasks

```
Fix the authentication bug where users can't log in with OAuth
```

```
Add input validation to the user registration form
```

```
Refactor the payment processing service to use the new API
```

## Composite Tasks

Composite tasks are designed for complex projects that require multiple coordinated steps. AutoDev uses AI to break down your request into a task graph (DAG structure) where tasks can run in parallel or sequence based on dependencies.

### How composite tasks work

1. **AI Planning** - AutoDev analyzes your request and creates a task graph
2. **Review Plan** - You see the proposed tasks and their dependencies
3. **Start Execution** - You approve the plan and start execution
4. **Sequential Execution** - Tasks become ready as dependencies complete
5. **Auto-approval (Optional)** - Enable auto-approval to run tasks automatically
6. **Coordinated Completion** - All tasks work together to complete your project

### When to use composite tasks

- **Large features** - Features that require multiple coordinated changes
- **System refactoring** - Major code restructure across multiple modules
- **New projects** - Setting up a new service or application from scratch
- **Complex integrations** - Integrating multiple systems or APIs
- **Multi-step migrations** - Database or infrastructure migrations

### Example composite tasks

```
Build a complete user authentication system with email verification,
password reset, and OAuth integration
```

```
Migrate our REST API to GraphQL, including schema design, resolvers,
and updating all client code
```

```
Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated testing, Docker deployment,
and monitoring
```

## Task Configuration

Both task types support optional configuration:

### Repository selection
Choose which repository the AI should work on. You can only select repositories where you've installed the AutoDev GitHub App.

### AI Agent selection (Optional)
Choose which AI coding agent to use:
- Claude Code
- Gemini CLI
- opencode
- Codex CLI
- Crush CLI
- GitHub Copilot CLI

If not specified, AutoDev uses your team's default agent.

### Model version (Optional)
Specify the AI model version (e.g., "sonnet", "gpt-4"). If not specified, the agent's default model is used.

### Base branch (Optional)
Specify which branch to use as the base for the task. Defaults to your repository's default branch (usually `main` or `master`).

## Task Status

Tasks progress through different statuses:

- **Pending** - Task created but not yet started
- **In Progress** - AI agent is working on the task
- **Completed** - All work finished and PRs created
- **Failed** - Task encountered an error
- **Cancelled** - Task was cancelled by user

## Pull Requests

Each task can create multiple pull requests. AutoDev automatically:

- Creates descriptive PR titles and descriptions
- Links PRs back to the task
- Posts the task prompt as a comment (configurable)
- Converts PRs to draft during automated updates
- Responds to code review comments
- Fixes failing CI checks
