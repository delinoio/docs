---

AutoDev is a fully automated development platform that uses AI coding agents to handle development tasks end-to-end. Instead of manually writing code, you describe what you need, and AutoDev's AI agents create pull requests, respond to code reviews, and fix CI failures automatically.

## How it works

1. **Connect your repository** - Install the AutoDev GitHub App on your repositories
2. **Describe your task** - Tell AutoDev what you want to build or fix
3. **AI creates PRs** - AutoDev's AI agents write code and create pull requests
4. **Automatic management** - AutoDev responds to reviews and fixes CI failures
5. **You review and merge** - Review the AI-generated code and merge when ready

## Key features

### Simple tasks
Perfect for straightforward development work like bug fixes, small features, or refactoring. AutoDev creates one or more pull requests to complete your task.

### Composite tasks
For complex projects, AutoDev breaks down your request into multiple coordinated tasks with AI-powered planning. Each task builds on previous work, creating a complete solution step by step.

### Automated PR management
- Responds to code review comments automatically
- Fixes failing CI checks without manual intervention
- Converts PRs to draft during updates to avoid confusion
- Posts task context as comments for reviewers

### Multiple AI agents
Choose from supported AI coding agents:
- [Claude Code](/autodev/ai-agents/claude-code)
- [Codex CLI](/autodev/ai-agents/codex-cli)
- [Gemini CLI (WIP)](/autodev/ai-agents/gemini-cli)
- [opencode (WIP)](/autodev/ai-agents/opencode)
- [Crush CLI (WIP)](/autodev/ai-agents/crush-cli)
- [GitHub Copilot CLI (WIP)](/autodev/ai-agents/github-copilot-cli)

## Use cases

- **Bug fixes** - Describe the bug and AutoDev creates a fix
- **New features** - Request a feature and get a complete implementation
- **Refactoring** - Improve code quality with automated refactoring
- **Documentation** - Generate or update documentation automatically
- **Test coverage** - Add tests to improve code coverage
- **Complex projects** - Break down large projects into manageable tasks
