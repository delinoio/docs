## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- An active AutoDev account
- Admin access to the GitHub organization or repository you want to connect
- A GitHub account linked to your organization

## Installing the GitHub App

Follow these steps to connect your GitHub repositories to AutoDev:

### 1. Navigate to Repositories

In the AutoDev app, select the **Repositories** menu from the navigation.

### 2. Connect your GitHub account

Click on the option to connect your GitHub account. You'll be redirected to GitHub to authorize the connection.

### 3. Install the GitHub App

Click **Install GitHub App** to begin the installation process.

When prompted to select repositories:
- We recommend selecting **Only select repositories**
- Choose only the repositories you plan to use with AutoDev
- This limits the app's access to only what you need

### 4. Connect repositories in AutoDev

After installation, return to the AutoDev app and select the repositories you want to use from the list of available repositories.

## Next steps

Once you've connected your repositories, you can start using AutoDev to automate your development workflow.
