AutoDev supports multiple AI agent providers to power your development automation. Choose the right agent based on your use case and budget.

## Supported AI Agents

You can configure the following AI agents in AutoDev:

- [Claude Code](/autodev/ai-agents/claude-code)
- [Codex CLI](/autodev/ai-agents/codex-cli)
- [Crush CLI](/autodev/ai-agents/crush-cli)
- [Gemini CLI](/autodev/ai-agents/gemini-cli)
- [GitHub Copilot CLI](/autodev/ai-agents/github-copilot-cli)
- [OpenCode](/autodev/ai-agents/opencode)

## Recommendations

### For Testing & Experimentation

If you're testing AutoDev or evaluating its capabilities, we recommend **OpenAI Codex with API Key** configuration:

- Quick setup with just an API key
- Pay-per-use pricing
- Good performance for basic automation tasks
- No subscription commitment required

### For Production Use

If you're serious about using AutoDev in your development workflow, we strongly recommend **Claude Code with Max Plan**:

- Superior code understanding and generation
- Best-in-class context handling
- Optimized for complex refactoring and architectural tasks
- Higher usage limits with Max subscription
- Most reliable for production workflows

## Using Multiple Agents

You can configure multiple AI agents in your GitHub repository. Once configured, you can select which agent to use for each task directly within the AutoDev app.
