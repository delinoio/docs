---

AutoDev automatically manages pull request reviews and updates, responding to feedback and fixing issues without manual intervention.

## The automated PR workflow

### 1. PR Creation
When AutoDev creates a pull request:
- PR is opened for review
- Task link comment is added
- Task prompt comment is added (if enabled)
- CI checks begin running

### 2. Code Review
Team members review the PR normally:
- Leave review comments
- Request changes
- Approve changes

### 3. Automatic Response
When a review is submitted, AutoDev:
- Detects the review via GitHub webhook
- Converts PR to draft status (except for simple approvals)
- Triggers a workflow to address the feedback
- AI agent analyzes the review and makes changes
- Pushes updates to the PR branch
- CI checks run again

### 4. CI Monitoring
AutoDev watches CI check status:
- When all checks complete
- If any checks fail
- Automatically triggers fix workflow
- AI agent investigates and fixes failures
- Updates are pushed to the PR

### 5. Ready for Merge
When everything passes:
- All CI checks pass
- All review feedback addressed
- PR is automatically undrafted (if enabled)
- Ready for final approval and merge

## PR comments

### Task Link Comment
Always added to every AutoDev PR:

```markdown
ðŸ¤– This pull request has been linked to AutoDev Task #123

View the task details and manage the automated development
workflow in AutoDev.
```

Provides:
- Link to the AutoDev task
- Task ID reference
- Context for reviewers

### Task Prompt Comment
Optional, enabled by default. Shows the original task prompt in PR comments to provide context for reviewers.

For details about this feature including benefits and how to configure it, see [Enable Prompt Comments](/autodev/settings#enable-prompt-comments) in the settings documentation.

## Review types and behavior

### Changes Requested
When reviewer requests changes:
1. PR converts to draft
2. AutoDev workflow triggered
3. AI analyzes review comments
4. Changes are made and pushed
5. PR remains draft until CI passes

### Comments Only
When reviewer adds comments (not requesting changes):
1. PR converts to draft
2. AutoDev workflow triggered
3. AI addresses comments
4. Updates pushed to PR
5. PR remains draft until CI passes

### Approvals
When reviewer approves without comments:
1. PR stays as-is (not converted to draft)
2. No workflow triggered
3. PR ready for merge (if CI passes)

### Bot Reviews
When a bot account submits a review, behavior depends on the "Auto-apply Bot Reviews" setting. See [Settings](/autodev/settings) for details.

## Draft status during updates

AutoDev converts PRs to draft during automated updates to:
- Signal work is in progress
- Prevent accidental merges during changes
- Avoid confusing reviewers
- Indicate AI is actively working

**Exception**: Simple approvals don't trigger draft conversion.

## Automatic CI fixes

When CI checks fail:

### Detection
AutoDev monitors:
- `check_run` webhooks
- `check_suite` webhooks
- Waits for all checks to complete
- Identifies failing checks

### Fix Workflow
If failures detected:
1. Creates fix workflow execution
2. Converts PR to draft
3. Generates detailed fix prompt with:
   - Original task prompt
   - List of failing checks
   - Links to check details
4. AI investigates failures using GitHub CLI
5. Fixes are made and pushed
6. CI runs again

### Rate Limiting
To prevent excessive fix attempts:
- Maximum 1 fix attempt per commit
- Tracked by commit SHA
- New commits allow new fix attempts

## Auto-undraft feature

When enabled (default), AutoDev automatically converts draft PRs to ready-for-review when all CI checks pass.

For details about this feature including when to enable/disable it and configuration options, see [Auto-undraft PR](/autodev/settings#auto-undraft-pr) in the settings documentation.

## Best practices

### For Reviewers

**Be specific in feedback:**
```
Please add error handling for the null case on line 45
```
Better than:
```
Needs error handling
```

**Reference specific code:**
```
In UserService.authenticateUser(), add rate limiting
to prevent brute force attacks
```

**Provide context:**
```
This approach won't work with our existing session
management. Please use the SessionManager class instead.
```

### For PR Authors

**Monitor automated updates:**
- Check that AutoDev addressed your feedback
- Review changes made by AI
- Add manual updates if needed

**Collaborate with AI:**
- Request updates through AutoDev
- Let AI handle repetitive fixes
- Make final manual adjustments

**Keep PRs focused:**
- Single responsibility per PR
- Easier for AI to maintain
- Faster review cycles

## Manual PR updates

You can also manually request PR updates:

1. Go to AutoDev task details
2. Find the PR you want to update
3. Click **Update PR**
4. Enter update instructions
5. AutoDev converts PR to draft and makes changes

Use manual updates when:
- Review feedback is complex
- Need additional features
- Want to refine the implementation
