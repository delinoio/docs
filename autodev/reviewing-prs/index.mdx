---

AutoDev automatically manages pull request reviews and updates, responding to feedback and fixing issues without manual intervention.

## The automated PR workflow

### 1. PR Creation
When AutoDev creates a pull request:
- PR is opened for review
- Task link comment is added
- Task prompt comment is added (if enabled)
- CI checks begin running

### 2. Code Review
Team members review the PR normally:
- Leave review comments
- Request changes
- Approve changes

### 3. Automatic Response
When a review is submitted, AutoDev:
- Detects the review via GitHub webhook
- Converts PR to draft status (except for simple approvals)
- Triggers a workflow to address the feedback
- AI agent analyzes the review and makes changes
- Pushes updates to the PR branch
- CI checks run again

### 4. CI Monitoring
AutoDev watches CI check status:
- When all checks complete
- If any checks fail
- Automatically triggers fix workflow
- AI agent investigates and fixes failures
- Updates are pushed to the PR

### 5. Ready for Merge
When everything passes:
- All CI checks pass
- All review feedback addressed
- PR is automatically undrafted (if enabled)
- Ready for final approval and merge

## PR comments

### Task Link Comment
Always added to every AutoDev PR:

```markdown
🤖 This pull request has been linked to AutoDev Task #123

View the task details and manage the automated development
workflow in AutoDev.
```

Provides:
- Link to the AutoDev task
- Task ID reference
- Context for reviewers

### Task Prompt Comment
Optional, enabled by default. Shows the original task prompt in PR comments to provide context for reviewers.

For details about this feature including benefits and how to configure it, see [Enable Prompt Comments](/autodev/settings#enable-prompt-comments) in the settings documentation.

## Review types and behavior

### Changes Requested
When reviewer requests changes:
1. PR converts to draft
2. AutoDev workflow triggered
3. AI analyzes review comments
4. Changes are made and pushed
5. PR remains draft until CI passes

### Comments Only
When reviewer adds comments (not requesting changes):
1. PR converts to draft
2. AutoDev workflow triggered
3. AI addresses comments
4. Updates pushed to PR
5. PR remains draft until CI passes

### Approvals
When reviewer approves without comments:
1. PR stays as-is (not converted to draft)
2. No workflow triggered
3. PR ready for merge (if CI passes)

### Bot Reviews
When a bot account submits a review, behavior depends on the "Auto-apply Bot Reviews" setting. See [Settings](/autodev/settings) for details.

## Reviewer permissions

For security, AutoDev verifies that reviewers have appropriate permissions before triggering workflows:

### Write Access Requirement
**For human reviewers:**
- Must have **Write** (Push) or **Admin** access to the repository
- Verified via GitHub API permission check
- Reviews from users without write access are silently ignored
- All permission checks are logged for security auditing

**For bot reviewers:**
- Exempt from permission checks when "Auto-apply Bot Reviews" is enabled
- Use GitHub App installation token for authentication
- Bypasses individual permission requirements

### Why write access is required
This security measure prevents:
- Unauthorized users from triggering workflows via PR reviews
- Potential abuse of compute resources
- Unauthorized code execution in your workflows

### Troubleshooting permission issues
If your reviews aren't triggering workflows:
1. Verify you have **Write** or **Admin** access to the repository
2. Check that you've connected the repository in AutoDev
3. Ensure the repository has AutoDev webhook configured
4. Review webhook delivery logs for permission errors

**Note**: Read-only collaborators cannot trigger AutoDev workflows through PR reviews, even if they've connected the repository.

## Draft status during updates

AutoDev converts PRs to draft during automated updates to:
- Signal work is in progress
- Prevent accidental merges during changes
- Avoid confusing reviewers
- Indicate AI is actively working

**Exception**: Simple approvals don't trigger draft conversion.

## Automatic CI fixes

When CI checks fail:

### Detection
AutoDev monitors:
- `check_run` webhooks
- `check_suite` webhooks
- Waits for all checks to complete
- Identifies failing checks

### Fix Workflow
If failures detected:
1. Creates fix workflow execution
2. Converts PR to draft
3. Generates detailed fix prompt with:
   - Original task prompt
   - List of failing checks
   - Links to check details
4. AI investigates failures using GitHub CLI
5. Fixes are made and pushed
6. CI runs again

### Rate Limiting
To prevent excessive fix attempts:
- Maximum 1 fix attempt per commit
- Tracked by commit SHA
- New commits allow new fix attempts

## Auto-undraft feature

When enabled (default), AutoDev automatically converts draft PRs to ready-for-review when all CI checks pass.

For details about this feature including when to enable/disable it and configuration options, see [Auto-undraft PR](/autodev/settings#auto-undraft-pr) in the settings documentation.

## GitHub Ruleset recommendations

To optimize AutoDev's automated workflow, we recommend configuring GitHub Rulesets to protect your repository while allowing AutoDev to work efficiently.

### Recommended ruleset configuration

**Branch protection rules:**
- **Require pull request reviews** - Ensure human oversight of AI-generated code
- **Require status checks to pass** - Enforce CI validation before merging
- **Allow force pushes: Enable for AutoDev bot** - Let AutoDev clean up commit history after addressing reviews
- **Allow deletions: Disable** - Protect branches from accidental deletion

**Why allow force pushes for AutoDev:**
When AutoDev addresses review feedback or fixes CI failures, it may need to force push to maintain a clean commit history. This is safe because:
- Only the AutoDev bot account has this permission
- Changes still go through PR review
- CI checks must still pass
- Human approval required for merge

**Setting up the ruleset:**
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to Rules → Rulesets
3. Create a new ruleset for your target branches (e.g., `main`, `develop`)
4. Configure branch protections as above
5. Under "Bypass list," add the AutoDev bot account for force push permissions

This configuration ensures code quality while allowing AutoDev to manage PRs efficiently without manual intervention.

## Best practices

### For Reviewers

**Be specific in feedback:**
```
Please add error handling for the null case on line 45
```
Better than:
```
Needs error handling
```

**Reference specific code:**
```
In UserService.authenticateUser(), add rate limiting
to prevent brute force attacks
```

**Provide context:**
```
This approach won't work with our existing session
management. Please use the SessionManager class instead.
```

### For PR Authors

**Monitor automated updates:**
- Check that AutoDev addressed your feedback
- Review changes made by AI
- Add manual updates if needed

**Collaborate with AI:**
- Request updates through AutoDev
- Let AI handle repetitive fixes
- Make final manual adjustments

**Keep PRs focused:**
- Single responsibility per PR
- Easier for AI to maintain
- Faster review cycles

## Manual PR updates

You can also manually request PR updates:

1. Go to AutoDev task details
2. Find the PR you want to update
3. Click **Update PR**
4. Enter update instructions
5. AutoDev converts PR to draft and makes changes

Use manual updates when:
- Review feedback is complex
- Need additional features
- Want to refine the implementation

## Applying reviews from other reviewers

You can apply review feedback from other pull requests using the Reflect command:

1. Find the review comment you want to apply.
2. Copy the comment's direct link (e.g., `https://github.com/delinoio/autodev-example/pull/123#issuecomment-337041341`)
3. On the current PR, submit a review with "Request changes"
4. In the review message, use: `Reflect https://github.com/delinoio/autodev-example/pull/123#issuecomment-337041341`
5. AutoDev will analyze the linked review comment and apply those changes to the current PR

This is useful when:
- Applying reviews from other people
