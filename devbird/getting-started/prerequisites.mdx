Before you begin using DevBird, ensure you have the following:

## Delino Account

You need either a **Delino Pro** or **Delino Team** account to use DevBird.

The pricing of DevBird is **\$0.01 per workflow execution, with a minimum charge of \$10 per month**.

Both plans offer the same features:

- **Pro**: Includes a 7-day free trial
- **Team**: Fixed monthly price regardless of team size

## GitHub Repository

DevBird requires a GitHub repository to work with. Both public and private repositories are supported.

You'll need to install the GitHub App and grant DevBird access to your repositories. See [Installing GitHub App](./github-app) for detailed instructions.

## Next steps

Once you have your Delino account and GitHub repository ready, proceed to [Installing GitHub App](./github-app) to connect them.
