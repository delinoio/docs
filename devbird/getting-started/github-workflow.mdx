<Note>
  Recently `autodev.yml` is renamed to `devbird.yml` because the product is
  rebranded. But for backward compatibility, `autodev.yml` will just work as
  before.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Completed the [GitHub App installation](/devbird/getting-started/github-app)
- Admin or write access to your repository
- Required secrets configured in your GitHub repository

## Setting up the workflow

Follow these steps to add the DevBird workflow to your repository:

### 1. Create the workflow file

Create a new file at `.github/workflows/devbird.yml` in your repository.

### 2. Add the workflow configuration

Copy the following YAML configuration into the file:

```yaml
name: "DevBird"
run-name: "DevBird: ${{ inputs.task_title }}"

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      prompt:
        description: "Instructions for DevBird. Can be a direct prompt or custom template."
        type: string
        required: true

      base_branch:
        description: "The branch to use as the base/source when creating new branches (defaults to repository default branch)"
        type: string
        required: false
        default: "main"

      agent:
        description: "The agent to use for the action. Can be 'claude_code', 'gemini_cli', 'codex_cli' or 'opencode'"
        type: choice
        default: "claude_code"
        options:
          - claude_code
          - gemini_cli
          - codex_cli
          - opencode
          - crush_cli
          - github_copilot_cli

      agent_model:
        description: "The (optional) model to use for the agent"
        type: string
        required: false
        default: ""

      devbird_workflow_execution_token:
        description: "The token to use for the DevBird task"
        type: string
        required: false
        default: ""

      devbird_mode:
        description: "The DevBird execution mode. Can be 'develop' (default) or 'plan' (for task graph planning)"
        type: choice
        default: "develop"
        options:
          - develop
          - plan

      task_title:
        description: "The title of the DevBird task"
        type: string
        required: false
        default: ""

jobs:
  devbird:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
      id-token: write
      actions: read # Required for Claude to read CI results on PRs
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v5

      # Setup step.
      # See next section for the documentation
      # - name: Setup Node.js
      #   uses: actions/setup-node

      - name: Run DevBird
        uses: delinoio/devbird-action@main
        with:
          agent: ${{ inputs.agent }}
          agent_model: ${{ inputs.agent_model }}
          devbird_mode: ${{ inputs.devbird_mode }}
          devbird_workflow_execution_token: ${{ inputs.devbird_workflow_execution_token }}
          prompt: ${{ inputs.prompt }}
          base_branch: ${{ inputs.base_branch }}
          delino_access_token: ${{ secrets.DELINO_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          claude_code_oauth_token: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
          openai_api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

### 3. Customize the setup steps

The workflow includes a setup step that you should customize for your repository:

```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node
```

Replace these with your project's setup steps. The steps here should configure a complete development environment for the AI agent.

<Info>

For example, the Delino monorepo includes steps for

- installing protoc for RPC definitions
- installing golang for backend servers
- installing nodejs for next.js apps
- fetching environment variables for development environment

</Info>

### 4. Configure `DELINO_ACCESS_TOKEN`

Create a new API key following the guide at [Creating API Keys](/core/api-keys/creation) and add it as a repository secret on GitHub settings.

### 5. Commit to your main branch

Commit the workflow file to your repository's main branch:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/devbird.yml
git commit -m "Add DevBird workflow"
git push
```

## Understanding workflow execution

<Info>
**Important: Workflow runs on the main branch**

For security reasons, the DevBird GitHub Action always executes on your repository's default branch (typically `main`). This means:

- The workflow runs from the main branch codebase
- GitHub Actions logs will show the workflow running on `main`
- This is by design to prevent security vulnerabilities

The `base_branch` parameter controls which branch DevBird uses as the base when creating new feature branches, but the workflow execution itself always happens on the default branch.
</Info>

This security design prevents potential issues such as:

- Malicious workflow modifications in feature branches
- Unauthorized access to repository secrets
- Tampering with the DevBird workflow configuration

## Next steps

Once the workflow is set up, you can start using DevBird to automate development tasks. Learn how to trigger your first DevBird task in the [Creating your first PR](/devbird/getting-started/first-pr) guide.
