---

DevBird is a fully automated development platform that uses AI coding agents to handle development tasks end-to-end. Instead of manually writing code, you describe what you need, and DevBird's AI agents create pull requests, respond to code reviews, and fix CI failures automatically.

## How it works

1. **Connect your repository** - Install the DevBird GitHub App on your repositories
2. **Describe your task** - Tell DevBird what you want to build or fix
3. **AI creates PRs** - DevBird's AI agents write code and create pull requests
4. **Automatic management** - DevBird responds to reviews and fixes CI failures
5. **You review and merge** - Review the AI-generated code and merge when ready

## Key features

### Simple tasks

Perfect for straightforward development work like bug fixes, small features, or refactoring. DevBird creates one or more pull requests to complete your task.

### Composite tasks

For complex projects, DevBird breaks down your request into multiple coordinated tasks with AI-powered planning. Each task builds on previous work, creating a complete solution step by step.

### Automated PR management

- Responds to code review comments automatically
- Fixes failing CI checks without manual intervention
- Converts PRs to draft during updates to avoid confusion
- Posts task context as comments for reviewers

### Multiple AI agents

Choose from [supported AI coding agents](/devbird/getting-started/ai-agent).

## Use cases
