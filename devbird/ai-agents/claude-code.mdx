<Note>
  This guide covers connecting Claude Code to your repository. To set up DevBird
  itself, please refer to the [DevBird setup
  guide](/devbird/getting-started/prerequisites).
</Note>

Claude Code is Anthropic's AI coding assistant. When integrated with DevBird, it can automate code generation, bug fixes, refactoring, and more through natural language commands.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Claude Code installed on your machine
- A Claude subscription (recommended for long-lived token option)
- Repository access where you want to use DevBird

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Launch Claude Code

1. Open Claude Code
2. Navigate to your project directory

### Step 2: Install GitHub App

1. In the Claude Code terminal, run:

   ```bash
   /install-github-app
   ```

2. A browser window will open automatically

### Step 3: Select Repository

Select the repository where you want to use DevBird from the list presented.

### Step 4: Install GitHub App

Follow the GitHub prompts to install the DevBird app to your selected repository.

### Step 5: Configure Workflows

When Claude Code displays the `Select GitHub workflows to install` screen, press Enter to continue with the default workflow selection.

### Step 6: Choose Authentication Method

Claude Code will present the `Install GitHub App` screen with authentication options:

- **Create a long-lived token with your Claude subscription** (Recommended)

  - Uses your existing Claude subscription (flat rate billing)
  - More cost-effective for regular use
  - Requires approval on the Anthropic website

- **Enter a new API key**
  - Pay-as-you-go pricing model
  - Charges based on usage

<Note>
  We recommend the long-lived token option if you have a Claude subscription, as
  it provides predictable costs.
</Note>

### Step 7: Approve on Anthropic Website

If you selected the long-lived token option, approve the connection on the Anthropic website when prompted.

### Step 8: Handle Setup Pull Request

Claude Code will automatically create a setup pull request in your repository:

- **If you plan to use Claude Code directly**: Review and merge the PR
- **If you only plan to use DevBird (without using Claude Code directly)**: You don't need this PR - you can close it without merging
- **If you're just testing**: You can close the PR without merging
