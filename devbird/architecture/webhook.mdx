## Overview

DevBird uses webhooks to receive real-time notifications from GitHub about events in your repositories. This enables DevBird to automatically respond to pull request reviews, CI status changes, and other repository events.

## GitHub Webhooks

DevBird uses GitHub App webhooks to receive events:

- Uses GitHub App webhooks or repository webhooks
- Validates webhook signatures using the webhook secret
- Receives events via the GitHub App installation

## Webhook Events

DevBird listens for the following webhook events:

### Pull Request Events

- **Pull Request Opened**: Triggered when a new PR is created
  - DevBird posts task context as a comment
  - Links the PR to the originating task
- **Pull Request Closed**: Triggered when a PR is merged or closed
  - Updates task status
  - Triggers completion notifications if all PRs are merged
- **Pull Request Synchronized**: Triggered when new commits are pushed
  - Updates PR status in DevBird

### Review Events

- **Pull Request Review Submitted**: Triggered when a review is posted
  - DevBird analyzes review comments
  - Triggers AI agent to address feedback
  - Creates new commits to address comments
- **Pull Request Review Comment**: Triggered when inline comments are added
  - Triggers targeted code fixes for specific comments

### Status Events

- **Check Run Completed**: Triggered when CI checks finish
  - DevBird monitors for failures
  - Automatically triggers CI fix workflow for failed checks
  - Undrafts PR when all checks pass (if auto-undraft is enabled)
- **Status**: Legacy status API events
  - Backward compatibility for older CI systems
