This guide helps you troubleshoot common issues with unit tasks in DevBird.

## Task Creation Issues

### Task Not Starting

**Symptoms:**

- Task stuck in "Pending" status
- No workflow execution visible in GitHub Actions
- Task created but nothing happens

**Possible Causes:**

1. Workflow file missing or incorrect
2. GitHub Actions disabled
3. Repository not properly connected
4. Workflow dispatch failed

**Solutions:**

**Check workflow file exists:**

```bash
# Verify file exists
ls .github/workflows/devbird.yml

# Check file is on default branch
git branch --show-current
```

**Verify GitHub Actions is enabled:**

1. Go to repository Settings
2. Navigate to Actions → General
3. Ensure "Allow all actions and reusable workflows" is selected

**Reconnect repository:**

1. DevBird → Repositories
2. Find your repository
3. Click "Disconnect" then "Reconnect"

**Manually retry:**

1. Go to task details page
2. Click "Retry Task" button
3. Check workflow execution logs

### Invalid Configuration Error

**Symptoms:**

- Task fails immediately
- Error: "Invalid agent configuration"
- Workflow execution shows configuration error

**Possible Causes:**

1. AI agent API key not set
2. Invalid agent type specified
3. Model type not supported

**Solutions:**

**Verify API key:**

1. Repository Settings → Secrets → Actions
2. Check required secret exists (e.g., `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
3. Regenerate key if needed

**Check agent configuration:**

- Agent type must be one of the [supported AI agents](/devbird/getting-started/ai-agent)
- Model type must match agent's supported models

**Use default settings:**

- Leave agent/model fields empty to use team defaults
- Verify team defaults in Settings page

## Workflow Execution Issues

### Workflow Fails to Trigger

**Symptoms:**

- Task status changes to "In Progress" but no GitHub Actions run
- No workflow run visible in Actions tab
- Task eventually times out

**Solutions:**

**Check workflow permissions:**

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  actions: read
```

**Verify workflow dispatch event:**

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch: # Must be present
    inputs:
      devbird_task_token:
        required: true
```

**Check GitHub API status:**

- Visit [githubstatus.com](https://www.githubstatus.com)
- Look for API or Actions outages

### Workflow Hangs or Timeouts

**Symptoms:**

- Workflow runs for extended period
- Eventually times out (2+ hours)
- No progress updates

**Solutions:**

**Add timeout to workflow:**

```yaml
jobs:
  devbird:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 60 # 1 hour max
```

**Check runner availability:**

- If using self-hosted runners, verify they're online
- Switch to GitHub-hosted runners temporarily

**Simplify the task:**

- Break large task into smaller pieces
- Reduce scope of changes requested
- Be more specific in prompt

### Authentication Errors

**Symptoms:**

- Error: "Authentication failed"
- Error: "Invalid task token"
- Workflow fails at authentication step

**Solutions:**

**Verify OIDC is configured:**

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write # Required for OIDC
```

**Check task token is passed:**

```yaml
- uses: delino-io/devbird-action@v1
  with:
    task_token: ${{ inputs.devbird_task_token }} # Must be present
```

**Repository must be connected:**

1. Verify repository appears in DevBird
2. Status should be "Connected"
3. Reconnect if needed

## Pull Request Creation Issues

### No PRs Created

**Symptoms:**

- Task completes successfully
- Status changes to "Completed"
- But no pull requests appear

**Possible Causes:**

1. AI determined no changes were needed
2. Changes were made but no branches registered
3. PR creation failed silently

**Solutions:**

**Check workflow logs:**

1. Go to GitHub Actions
2. Find the workflow run
3. Look for "Creating pull request" steps
4. Check for any errors

**Verify task prompt was clear:**

- Was the request specific enough?
- Did you specify what to create/change?
- Try rephrasing and creating new task

**Check branch was created:**

```bash
# List all branches
git branch -a

# Look for devbird-* branches
git branch -a | grep devbird
```

**Task may have legitimately completed without changes:**

- AI analyzed request
- Determined changes weren't needed
- This is normal behavior for some prompts

### PR Created on Wrong Branch

**Symptoms:**

- PR targets wrong base branch
- Changes based on wrong branch

**Solutions:**

**Specify base branch when creating task:**

1. In task creation form
2. Expand "Advanced Settings"
3. Set "Base Branch" to desired branch (e.g., "develop")

**Update workflow default:**

```yaml
base_branch:
  required: false
  default: "develop" # Change from 'main'
```

**For existing PR:**

- You can change the base branch on GitHub
- Go to PR → Click "Edit" near title
- Change base branch in dropdown

### Multiple Unwanted PRs

**Symptoms:**

- Task creates too many PRs
- PRs are fragmented
- Changes should be in one PR

**Cause:**

- AI decided to split changes across multiple PRs
- This is sometimes intentional for large changes

**Solutions:**

**For future tasks:**

- Add to prompt: "Create all changes in a single PR"
- Be more specific about scope

**For existing PRs:**

- Manually merge the branches
- Close extra PRs
- Keep the main one

## Code Quality Issues

### Generated Code Doesn't Compile

**Symptoms:**

- CI checks fail
- Code has syntax errors
- Build fails

**Solutions:**

**Let DevBird auto-fix:**

- Wait for automatic CI fix workflow
- DevBird detects failures and attempts fixes
- Usually completes in 5-10 minutes

**Provide feedback via review:**

1. Leave review comment on specific lines
2. Request changes
3. DevBird will update the code

**Manual update request:**

1. Go to task details
2. Click "Update PR"
3. Provide specific fix instructions

### Code Doesn't Match Requirements

**Symptoms:**

- Code works but doesn't do what you wanted
- Missing features
- Wrong approach

**Solutions:**

**Review and request changes:**

1. Leave detailed review comments
2. Explain what's wrong and what you expected
3. Request changes on GitHub PR
4. DevBird will address feedback

**Update the PR:**

1. Task details → Update PR
2. Provide additional context
3. Clarify requirements

**Create new task:**

- If changes are too different
- Delete current task
- Create new task with clearer prompt

### Code Style Doesn't Match Project

**Symptoms:**

- Code formatting is different
- Naming conventions don't match
- Structure is inconsistent

**Solutions:**

**Request style fixes:**

- Leave review comment
- Reference your style guide
- Example: "Please follow naming conventions in @CONTRIBUTING.md"

**Set up linters:**

- Add ESLint, Prettier, or other formatters to CI
- DevBird will see failures and auto-fix

**Improve future prompts:**

```
Follow the code style in @src/services/example.ts
Use the same patterns as existing services
```

## Status and Sync Issues

### Task Stuck "In Progress"

**Symptoms:**

- Task has been "In Progress" for hours/days
- Workflow completed but status didn't update
- PRs are created but task status unchanged

**Solutions:**

**Sync task status:**

1. Go to task details page
2. Click "Sync Task" (in debug/actions menu)
3. DevBird checks PR status and updates task

**Check workflow execution:**

- Look at workflow execution history
- See if workflow actually completed
- Check for errors in logs

**Manual status check:**

- If all PRs are merged → Task should be "Completed"
- If PRs are closed without merge → Task should be "Failed"
- Sync operation will fix this

### Task Status Incorrect

**Symptoms:**

- Task shows "Completed" but PRs still open
- Task shows "Failed" but PRs are merged
- Status doesn't reflect reality

**Solution:**

**Use Sync Task feature:**

1. Task details page
2. Sync Task button
3. Checks GitHub for actual PR status
4. Updates task status accordingly

**What Sync does:**

- Fetches latest PR data from GitHub
- Checks merge status
- Updates CI check status
- Recalculates task status

### Cannot Delete Task

**Symptoms:**

- Delete button doesn't work
- Error when trying to delete
- Task remains after delete attempt

**Solutions:**

**Check permissions:**

- Only task creator can delete
- Verify you're logged in as correct user

**Task may be running:**

- Wait for workflow to complete
- Cancel workflow first, then delete

**Force delete:**

1. Close all PRs manually on GitHub
2. Wait a few seconds
3. Retry delete in DevBird

## Performance Issues

### Task Takes Too Long

**Symptoms:**

- Task runs for 30+ minutes
- Much slower than expected
- Workflow seems stuck

**Possible Causes:**

1. Large codebase
2. Complex task
3. Slow AI agent response
4. Runner resource constraints

**Solutions:**

**Break into smaller tasks:**

- Split large request into focused tasks
- Each task completes faster
- Better for tracking progress

**Use faster agent/model:**

- Switch to GPT-3.5 or Claude Haiku
- Faster response times
- Trade quality for speed

**Optimize workflow:**

- Remove unnecessary setup steps
- Cache dependencies
- Use faster runner (self-hosted)

### Rate Limit Errors

**Symptoms:**

- Error: "Rate limit exceeded"
- Task fails with 429 error
- API quota exceeded

**Solutions:**

**For GitHub API limits:**

- Wait an hour for reset
- Reduce concurrent tasks
- Use GitHub App authentication (automatic)

**For AI provider limits:**

- Check provider dashboard for quota
- Upgrade API plan
- Wait for rate limit reset
- Switch to different agent temporarily
